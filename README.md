Tools for Grading Programs in GitHub Repositories

This is a set of shell scripts to automate tasks for 
evaluating and making changes 
to a large set of repositories. 
The cast includes: 



## The Cleaner

If you need to solve a problem, he's the guy to call. 



## The Checker

If you want to know what's there, this guy will find it. 


## The Cloner

If you need to produce a lot of clones, this is where to go.


## The Copier

I don't always need to copy multiple files...
but when I do I use this script. 


## The Puller

This is what you need to pull large amounts of new products. 


## The Sender

<img src="Images/Robert_Lee_Ermey_Full_Metal_Jacket.jpg" width="500"/>

This guy will put you in your place. 


## The Runner

<img src="Images/Tom_Cruise_American_Made.jpg" width="500"/>

This runs...computer programs. 


## The Pusher

When the work is done, push your changes and cruise away into the sunset.
