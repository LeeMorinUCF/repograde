Tools for Grading Programs in GitHub Repositories

This is a set of shell scripts to automate tasks for making changes 
to a large set of repositories. 
The cast includes: 



## The Cleaner

If you need to solve a problem, he's the guy to call. 



## The Checker

If you want to know what's there, this guy will find it. 


## The Cloner

If you need to produce a lot of clones, this is where to go.



## The Puller

<img src="Optimus_Prime_Transformers.jpg" width="500"/>

This is what you need to pull large amounts of new products. 


## The Sender

<img src="Michael_Madsen_Reservoir_Dogs.jpg" width="500"/>

If you need to make some moves, this guy will get it done. 

(Ok, that other movie sucked even though Michael Madsen was in it.
That's why I show a scene from Reservoir Dogs instead.) 


## The Runner

This runs...computer programs. 


## The Pusher

When the work is done, cruise away into the sunset.
